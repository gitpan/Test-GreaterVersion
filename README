This is the README file for Test::GreaterVersion, utilities
for comparing versions of development, installed and CPAN versions
of a module, by Gregor Goldbach <glauschwuffel@nomaden.org>.

Test::GreaterVersion uses the standard perl module installation
process.

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

This is my first module upload to CPAN, so please be gentle but
do give critic so I can improve ;-)
