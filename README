This is the README file for Test::GreaterVersion, utilities
for comparing versions of development, installed and CPAN versions
of a module, by Gregor Goldbach <glauschwuffel@nomaden.org>.

There are two functions which are supposed to be used
in your test suites to assure that you incremented your
version before your install the module or upload it to CPAN.

Test::GreaterVersion uses the standard perl module installation
process.

perl Makefile.PL
make
make test
make install

This is my first module upload to CPAN, so please be gentle but
do critisize me so I can improve ;-)
